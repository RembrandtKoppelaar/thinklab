THINKLAB Installation Instructions
==================================

Get a JDK
---------

Thinklab is a Java application released as source code, so you will
need a JDK in order to compile and run it. If you don't already have
one installed, you can download one from Oracle's website here:
http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/index.html

If you know what you are doing and would prefer to use a JDK by a
different vendor, have at it. We have not tested the three native
libraries below with JDK's other than Oracle's, so buyer beware and
all that.


Install some Java libraries
---------------------------

Because Thinklab makes heavy use of geospatial functions and produces
quite a few maps and images in different formats, you'll need to
install three platform native libraries (i.e. C code with Java
wrappers) into your JVM in order to run it:

- Java3d      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-138252.html
- JAI         http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/install-1-1-2-01-140526.html
- JAI-ImageIO http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/install-jai-imageio-1-0-01-139659.html


Install Ant
-----------

Now that your JDK and native Java libraries are installed, you'll need
a build tool to actually compile Thinklab for execution. Grab the
Apache Ant build tool here: http://ant.apache.org.


Set your Environment Variables
------------------------------

|-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JAVA_HOME         | directory where you installed your JDK                                |
| JAVA_OPTS         | options to your JVM (like min/max memory settings, server mode, etc.) |
| ANT_HOME          | directory where you installed Ant                                     |
| PATH              | make sure to add JAVA_HOME/bin and ANT_HOME/bin to this               |
| THINKLAB_JRE      | directory containing the JRE you want to run Thinklab with            |
| THINKLAB_MEMORY   | megabytes of RAM to allocate to your running Thinklab instance        |
| THINKLAB_PERMSIZE | megabytes of RAM to allocate to your JVM for Java class caching       |
| THINKLAB_SRC      | directory containing this INSTALL file                                |
| THINKLAB_HOME     | directory where you want to install the compiled version of Thinklab  |
|-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------|


Build Thinklab
--------------

On Windows, simply run the build_thinklab.bat script in the bin/
directory of this repository.

On MacOS X or Linux/FreeBSD/PickYourNix, open up a command prompt and:

  $ cd $THINKLAB_SRC
  $ ant install


Run Thinklab
------------

On Windows, run the run_thinklab.bat script in the bin/ directory of
this repository.

On MacOS X or Linux/FreeBSD/PickYourNix, open up a command prompt and:

  $ cd $THINKLAB_HOME
  $ ./bin/thinklab.sh

Alternatively, you could open a command prompt on any of these
systems, change directory to THINKLAB_HOME, and run java directly:

  $ java -jar lib\im-boot.jar   [windows]
  $ java -jar lib/im-boot.jar   [macosx/unix/linux]

In either case, you will be presented with a window containing a
command prompt. Type 'help' to see a list of the commands
available. Type 'help <command-name>' to see information about a
particular command. To quit the application, type 'exit'.

That's it. Enjoy.
