INSTALLING A THINKLAB SERVER 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Linux only!)

1. Create a new user directory on intended server. If remote publishing actions
   are desired, ensure it can write on publish directory (see below).
   
2. Unzip all content of install-package into home directory of said user.

3. Edit environment vars in provided .bashrc as follows:

	THINKLAB_STARTUP_SCRIPT=~/etc/rest.tl
	
		set xxx to ~/etc/aries.tl for ARIES web server OR
		leave default ~/etc/rest.tl for REST development server
		
		otherwise write your own thinklab script in etc/ and refer to it. Ensure it 
		ends with a server command which does not return control to the command line,
		otherwise it will block the server waiting for input.
		
	THINKLAB_REST_PORT=8182
	
		change 8182 to the port you want - if there are other servers on the same machine
		they need to use different ports. The default is OK for the first server, you
		can add 1 incrementally after that.
		
	THINKLAB_PUBLISH_DIRECTORY=dir
	
		if you want to enable --publish <file> commands in the remote shell, set this
		variable to a directory to publish to. The user needs to have write access to
		it, so if it's e.g. on the RAID make sure to setup group permissions 
		appropriately.
	
4. Ensure the admin user and password in .thinklab/users.xml are OK, change as required

5. Logoff and login again or source the bash scripts to enable settings

6. Run update.sh to clone, checkout and build the system.

7. Run startup.sh to start the server. From this point on everything should be controllable 
   from the remote shell, using the appropriate URL (a proxy must be established in the 
   http configuration of ecoinformatics if you're running on huginn and want to access from
   outside UVM). You should be able to rebuild and upgrade remotely - if things go wrong and
   the service stop being accessible, log back to huginn and run startup.sh again.
   
   Logs are written in logs/thinklab.log. Web directory is in .thinklab/.... Note: no more
   than one web app server should be active on one machine, so running 'pload explorer' and
   'http start aries' is a bad idea. Even if the port can be changed for the http server,
   ZK uses another port for Ajax communication whose address is in the web.xml file and
   changing that is nontrivial, so there will be conflicts if you run it. Best to connect
   to the actual ARIES instance and upgrade through the remote.
