We have estimated the current economic value of 17 ecosystem services for 16 biomes, based on published studies and a few original calculations. For the entire biosphere, the value (most of which is outside the market) is estimated to be in the range of US$16-54 trillion (10(12)) per year, with an average of US$33 trillion per year. Because of the nature of the uncertainties, this must be considered a minimum estimate. Global gross national product total is around US$18 trillion per year.")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "Although the effects of cultivation on soil organic matter and nutrient supply capacity are well understood, relatively little work has been done on the long-term recovery of soils from cultivation. We sampled soils from 12 locations within the Pawnee National Grasslands of northeastern Colorado, each having native fields and fields that were historically cultivated but abandoned 50 yr ago. We also sampled fields that had been cultivated for at least 50 yr at 5 of these locations. Our results demonstrated that soil organic matter, silt content, microbial biomass, potentially mineralizable N, and potentially respirable C were significantly lower on cultivated fields than on native fields. Both cultivated and abandoned fields also had significantly lower soil organic matter and silt contents than native fields. Abandoned fields, however, were not significantly different from native fields with respect to microbial biomass, potentially mineralizable N, or respirable C. In addition, we found that the characteristic small-scale heterogeneity of the shortgrass steppe associated with individuals of the dominant plant, Bouteloua gracilis, had recovered on abandoned fields. Soil beneath plant canopies had an average of 200 g/m(2) more C than between-plant locations. We suggest that 50 yr is an adequate time for recovery of active soil organic matter and nutrient availability, but recovery of total soil organic matter pools is a much slower process. Plant population dynamics may play an important role in the recovery of shortgrass steppe ecosystems from disturbance, such that establishment of perennial grasses determines the rate of organic matter recovery.")

Visitors were willing to pay to prevent the Preserve's conversion to agricultural uses. Monteverde's value as a cloud forest preserve appears much higher than any value it might have in agricultural use. Despite lower incomes, Costa Rican visitors valued the Preserve more highly than non-Costa Rican visitors. Visitors may have differentiated only weakly between greatly differing bid amounts. Expected values derived from econometric analysis of the differing experimental treatments suggest that further methodological adaptation of the contingent valuation method may be required (1) when it is applied in third world settings, and (2) when precision is critical in estimating WTPs.")

This paper develops an ecological-economic argument for the effective management of plant invasions in mountain fynbos ecosystems. We do this by building a dynamic ecological economic model which values the ecosystem services that fynbos ecosystems provide under different management regimes. We propose that the services that mountain fynbos ecosystems provide fall into six components: water production, wildflower harvest, hiker visitation, ecotourist visitation, endemic species and genetic storage. A scenario analysis based on a hypothetical 4 km(2) mountain fynbos ecosystem in the western part of the fynbos biome estimated that the ecosystem's value varies from R19 million (under low valuation and poor management scenario) to R300 million (under high valuation and good management scenario) [R4.50=US$1]. Water production and genetic storage were the most valuable ecosystem services. The model showed that the cost of clearing alien plants (under the proactive management scenario) was a tiny (0.6-5%) proportion of the value of mountain fynbos ecosystems.

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "Trends in global and United States fish catches were examined to determine the status of estuarine fisheries yields relative to those from other ecosystems. Potential marine fish production, based upon primary production relationships, was estimated globally and for specific marine ecosystems, including estuaries. While global fish catches increased substantially during the past two decades and continued to increase through 1989, catches of estuarine-dependent species have peaked or stabilized. In the United States, total catches have increased but many estuarine-dependent fisheries have declined, although the declines in catches are no more dramatic than those of heavily-fished continental shelf species. Overfishing probably is the primary cause of declines in estuarine and shelf fisheries. A few estuarine-dependent species of the United States have experienced substantial increases in harvests since 1970, for example, Pacific salmons, menhaden, and penaeid shrimps. The percentage contribution of major estuarine fisheries to the United States commercial catch declined between 1970 and 1990, although the yield of these species increased substantially. Global marine fisheries production at trophic level 2.5 was estimated to be 1,359 million tons. Potential yield was estimated to be 307 million tons, but the 1989 world marine catch was only 86.5 million tons. The major fraction, 196 million tons, of the estimated potential yield was for the open ocean where technological constraints may prevent its full realization. Of the remaining 111 million tons of the potential, 18.0 million tons (16.2%) may come from estuaries and probably already is fully exploited. The potential catches from shelves, 68.5 million tons (61.6%), and upwelling areas, 24.8 million tons (22.2%), while considerably larger than those from estuaries, are lower in a relative sense (per unit area) than fisheries production and potential catch in estuarine zones. Relationships between fish production, fish harvest, and primary production were examined in specific estuaries. The developing role of aquaculture and its effect on estuarine fisheries are discussed")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "We present estimates of total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes in rivers to the North Atlantic Ocean from 14 regions in North America, South America, Europe, and Africa which collectively comprise the drainage basins to the North Atlantic. The Amazon basin dominates the overall phosphorus flux and has the highest phosphorus flux per area. The total nitrogen flux from the Amazon is also large, contributing 3.3 Tg yr(-1) out of a total for the entire North Atlantic region of 13.1 Tg yr(-1). On a per area basis, however, the largest nitrogen fluxes are found in the highly disturbed watersheds around the North Sea, in northwestern Europe, and in the northeastern U.S., all of which have riverine nitrogen fluxes greater than 1,000 kg N km(-2) yr(-1). Non-point sources of nitrogen dominate riverine fluxes to the coast in all regions. River fluxes of total nitrogen from the temperate regions of the North Atlantic basin are correlated with population density, as has been observed previously for fluxes of nitrate in the world's major rivers. However, more striking is a strong linear correlation between river fluxes of total nitrogen and the sum of anthropogenically-derived nitrogen inputs to the temperate regions (fertilizer application, human-induced increases in atmospheric deposition of oxidized forms of nitrogen, fixation by leguminous crops, and the import/export of nitrogen in agricultural products). On average, regional nitrogen fluxes in rivers are only 25% of these anthropogenically derived nitrogen inputs. Denitrification in wetlands and aquatic ecosystems is probably the dominant sink, with storage in forests perhaps also of importance. Storage of nitrogen in groundwater, although of importance in some localities, is a very small sink for nitrogen inputs in all regions. Agricultural sources of nitrogen dominate inputs in many regions, particularly the Mississippi basin and the North Sea drainages. Deposition of oxidized nitrogen, primarily of industrial origin, is the major control over river nitrogen export in some regions such as the northeastern U.S. Using data from relatively pristine areas as an index of change, we estimate that riverine nitrogen fluxes in many of the temperate regions have increased from pre-industrial times by 2 to 20 fold, although some regions such as northern Canada are relatively unchanged. Fluxes from the most disturbed region, the North Sea drainages, have increased by 6 to 20 fold. Fluxes from the Amazon basin are also at least 2 to 5 fold greater than estimated fluxes from undisturbed temperate-zone regions, despite low population density and low inputs of anthropogenic nitrogen to the region. This suggests that natural riverine nitrogen fluxes in the tropics may be significantly greater than in the temperate zone. However, deforestation may be contributing to the tropical fluxes. In either case, projected increases in fertilizer use and atmospheric deposition in the coming decades are likely to cause dramatic increases in nitrogen loading to many tropical river systems.")

In addition, soil organic matter recovery on previously cultivated fields is not well understood. In this study, we identified seven sites that have native and abandoned fields and five sites that have native, abandoned, and cultivated fields. All sites are in the northeastern Colorado shortgrass steppe, crossing a precipitation range from 320 to 370 mm, and have sand contents from 36 to 67%. Historical cultivation reduced soil C and N across this region by between 16 and 42%. Although variation in native soil C and N at these sites correlates with climate and soil texture, variation among sites in soil losses due to cultivation is not explained by these variables. We used a statistical model and a simulation model to estimate patterns of soil loss across sites; neither model predicted variation among sites adequately (P > 0.05). We suggest that local-scale variability in organic matter losses due to cultivation are strongly dependent on management practices. With a simulation model and the data from native, abandoned, and cultivated fields, we estimated that 25 to 120 g C m(-2) have been recovered on the abandoned fields during the past 50 yr. Such rates of recovery are small compared with loss rates due to cultivation.

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "Five large rivers that discharge on the western North Atlantic continental shelf carry about 45% of the nitrogen (N) and 70% of the phosphorus (P) that others estimate to be the total flux of these elements from the entire North Atlantic watershed, including North, Central and South America, Europe, and Northwest Africa. We estimate that 61 . 10(9) moles y(-1) of N and 20 . 10(9) moles y(-1) of P from the large rivers are buried with sediments in their deltas, and that an equal amount of N and P from the large rivers is lost to the shelf through burial of river sediments that are deposited directly on the continental slope. The effective transport of active N and P from land to the shelf through the very large rivers is thus reduced to 292 . 10(9) moles y(-1) of N and 13 . 10(9) moles y(-1) of P. The remaining riverine fluxes from land must pass through estuaries. An analysis of annual total N and total P budgets for various estuaries around the North Atlantic revealed that the net fractional transport of these nutrients through estuaries to the continental shelf is inversely correlated with the log mean residence time of water in the system. This is consistent with numerous observations of nutrient retention and loss in temperate lakes. Denitrification is the major process responsible for removing N in most estuaries, and the fraction of total N input that is denitrified appears to be directly proportional to the log mean water residence time. In general, we estimate that estuarine processes retain and remove 30-65% of the total N and 10-55% of the total P that would otherwise pass into the coastal ocean. The resulting transport through estuaries to the shelf amounts to 172-335 . 10(9) moles y(-1) of N and 11-19 . 10(9) moles y(-1) of P. These values are similar to the effective contribution from the large rivers that discharge directly on the shelf. For the North Atlantic shelf as a whole, N fluxes from major rivers and estuaries exceed atmospheric deposition by a factor of 3.5-4.7, but this varies widely among regions of the shelf. For example, on the U.S. Atlantic shelf and on the northwest European shelf, atmospheric deposition of N may exceed estuarine exports. Denitrification in shelf sediments exceeds the combined N input from land and atmosphere by a factor of 1.4-2.2. This deficit must be met by a flux of N from the deeper ocean. Burial of organic matter fixed on the shelf removes only a small fraction of the total N and P input (2-12% of N from land and atmosphere; 1-17% of P), but it may be a significant loss for P in the North Sea and some other regions. The removal of N and P in fisheries landings is very small. The gross exchange of N and P between the shelf and the open ocean is much lager than inputs from land and, for the North Atlantic shelf as a whole, it may be much larger than the N and P removed through denitrification, burial, and fisheries. Overall, the North Atlantic continental shelf appears to remove some 700-950 . 10(9) moles of N each year from the deep ocean and to transport somewhere between 18 and 30 . 10(9) moles of P to the open sea. If the N and P associated with riverine sediments deposited on the continental slope are included in the total balance, the net flux of N to the shelf is reduced by 60 . 10(9) moles y(-1) and the P flux to the ocean is increased by 20 . 10(9) moles y(-1). These conclusions are quite tentative. however, because of large uncertainties in our estimates of some important terms in the shelf mass balance.")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "Central Amazonia is characterized by high and intensive rainfall and permeable soils. When rainforests are cleared for agricultural use, the efficient nutrient recycling mechanisms of the forests are disrupted and the nutrient availability in the topsoil is increased by fertilization, thereby increasing the potential for nutrient leaching. In this study, the distribution of mineral N in the upper two meters of a ferralitic upland soil was evaluated as an indicator for nutrient leaching and for the potential contribution of the subsoil to crop nutrition. A perennial polyculture system with four tree crops and a leguminous cover crop at two fertilization levels was compared with a monoculture plantation of peach palm (Bactris gasipaes), spontaneous fallow and primary rainforest. Mineral N accumulated principally as nitrate in the subsoil under all agricultural crops and also under the primary forest, although to a lesser extent. Within the polyculture system, there were significant differences in N accumulation between the tree crop species, and for one of the species (Theobroma grandiflorum) also between fertilization levels. The principal sources of subsoil N were mineral fertilizer and presumably N from the mineralization of leguminous biomass and soil organic matter. The N losses from the agricultural systems and the absence of yield responses of the tree crops to N fertilization indicated that agricultural production was not limited by N at this site, or that N was too rapidly leached to be taken up efficiently by the crops. None of the tree crop species seemed to be efficient in capturing leached N, Strategies are discussed for reducing N losses from agricultural systems with perennial crops, including the development of site- and species-specific fertilizer recommendations, closer tree spacing, and the encouragement of lateral and vertical tree root development")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "Changes in land use, habitat fragmentation, nutrient enrichment, and environmental stress often lead to reduced plant diversity in ecosystems. However, it remains controversial whether these reductions in diversity will affect energy flow and nutrient cycling. Diversity has two components: species richness, or the number of plant species in a given area, and species evenness, or how well distributed abundance or biomass is among species within a community. We experimentally varied species evenness and the identity of the dominant plant species in an old field of Quebec to test whether plant productivity would increase with increasing levels of evenness, and whether relationships would be invariant with respect to species identity. Total and belowground biomass increased linearly with increasing levels of evenness after one growing season. These relationships did not depend on the identity of the dominant species. Relationships between aboveground biomass and evenness varied and depended on the identity of the dominant. Our results are largely consistent with the idea that human-influenced reductions in small-scale plant diversity, in this case evenness, will lead to indirect reductions in total primary productivity. Furthermore, because the evenness treatments were not confounded with species identity, our results suggest that diversity has an effect on plant productivity above and beyond the sampling effect (having a higher probability of species with higher growth rates in diverse communities) seen in studies that vary species richness.")

We have compiled field measurements of biomass and associated environmental data for multiple study sites in major grassland types worldwide. Where sufficient data were available, we compared aboveground and total NPP estimated by six computational methods (algorithms) for 31 grassland sites. As has been found previously, NPP estimates were 2-5 times higher using methods which accounted for the dynamics of dead matter, compared with what is still the most commonly applied estimate of NPP (maximum peak live biomass). It is suggested that assumptions such as the use of peak biomass as an indicator of NPP in grasslands may apply only within certain subbiomes, e.g. temperate steppe grasslands. Additional data on belowground dynamics, or other reliable estimates of belowground productivity, are required if grasslands are to be fully appreciated for their role in the global carbon cycle.")

Most northern wetlands, such as boreal and arctic ombrogenous bogs and most arctic mesic and wet ecosystem types, are poor in inorganic, plant-available nutrients because mineralization is restricted due to low temperatures and anoxic soils. This is particularly true in the Arctic because nutrient inputs from external sources quite often are small, and nutrient pools in the vegetation also are small. By contrast, the soil and the microbial biomass often contain large stocks of organically fixed nutrients that are largely unavailable to plants. The vegetation is adapted to the low availability of nutrients by the perennial nature of both entire plants and plant tissues, which minimizes the annual nutrient losses and reduces the demand for nutrient uptake to produce new tissues. Furthermore, many of the dominant plant life-forms can use soil organic nitrogen (N), either by direct uptake or through connections with ericoid or ectotrophic mycorrhizae, which reduces competition from other plant groups without the ability to utilize organic N.")

Properties measured were: abundances of the faunal groups Collembola (Insecta), Oribatida, Gamasida and Actinedida (Acarina); PLFA richness, abundance and diversity (indicating microbial diversity); ATP content (an index of soil biomass), soil respiration (CO2 production); and alkaline phosphatase, urease, chitinase, xylanase and laminarinase activities, as biochemical tracers of biotic activity. Most of these variables showed significant differences from site to site. In particular, the biochemical descriptors ATP content and phosphatase and urease activities varied in accordance with the amount of the clay-humic complex. The soils showed two strategies of litter degradation: (a) an enzymatic strategy, prevailing at the end of winter, when the edaphic climate is unfavourable; (b) a biotic strategy, based upon the work of the whole living community (fauna and microflora), at its maximum at the end of summer. Diversity of the microbial communities (as estimated by the PLFA richness) was highest in spring, when the carbon sources are complex (young litter), and subsequently decreased in inverse relationship with the specific activity of the biomass (viz, CO2 production-to-ATP ratio). This behaviour is attributed to an increase of the amount of simple organic compounds resulting from enzymatic activity and also to the activity of microphytophagous microarthropods.

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "The study area, within the Simlipal National Park, India, provides a rare variety of soil sampling sites. These include virgin forests in the proximity of several cultivated areas (where no chemical fertilizers or any modern technology has been used and where periods of cultivation vary from 5 to a little over 100 yr); samples from evergreen forests, deciduous forests and natural grasslands could also be obtained. The availability of numerous such samples made it possible to use statistical methods to evaluate the changes. This study showed that deforestation and cultivation result in statistically significant (P-0.05) reduction in organic C, total N and C:N ratios but no significant changes in total and available P levels; C:P and N:P ratios are also reduced. Loss of organic C and N occurs rapidly in the first 15 yr of cultivation and reaches quasi-steady state values around 1-2% organic C and 0.1-0.2% total N; extent of reduction is not related to initial levels. Significant reduction in C:N, C:P ratios following cultivation suggest that mineralisation losses of C are higher than loss of N whereas loss of P is lowest. Lack of significant correlation between organic C and P levels in all types of soils, suggests that the bulk of the P is in the inorganic form. Highest levels of organic C and N were observed in evergreen forests followed by deciduous forests, grasslands and cultivated areas in that order; total and available P levels, however, showed no significant differences. Evergreen vegetative cover appears to provide the ideal environment for organic matter accumulation.")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "1. Research into the successional responses of tropical forest communities following disturbance has potential applications for habitat restoration. Currently little is known of how these responses relate to the recovery of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Succession of assemblages of decomposer arthropods is essential for the recovery of the soil community and nutrient cycling processes. 2. This study investigated the successional response of a termite assemblage to the experimental perturbation of forest habitat in southern Cameroon, examining the implications for tropical forest restoration. A randomized block design consisting of four experimental perturbations of differing severity was established in an old secondary forest in the Mbalmayo Forest Reserve. Isolated control sites were left in undisturbed forest. Recovery of the termite assemblage was assessed by measuring termite species richness and abundance at regular intervals over the subsequent 12 months. 3. The speed of recovery of the termite assemblage varied with the type and extent of perturbation. In treatments involving severe soil and canopy disturbance, termite species richness and abundance recovered more rapidly when dead wood was left on the ground following perturbation. The availability of dead wood also resulted in recolonization by a subset of the termite assemblage that was distinct compositionally from that sampled from all other treatments. This subset at sites with additional dead wood included not only certain wood-feeding species, but also soil feeders. 4. The positive effects upon the termite assemblage of leaving substantial dead wood on the ground has implications for the restoration of tropical forests following human-induced disturbances such as logging. The accelerated recovery of termite diversity and assemblage composition is a significant component of soil community recovery and the restoration of nutrient cycles. These benefits are expected to influence soil fertility and, ultimately, forest regeneration. The duration and persistence of these effects will depend crucially on the type, scale and intensity of the original disturbance. The impact of termites on soil properties, and vice versa, clearly deserves more attention in studies of tropical forest regeneration and recovery.")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "Forestry in the Central-European mountains is confronted with a severe forest decline, which is attributed to the combined effects of 'borealization', brought about by large scale continued spruce (mainly Picea abies) monocultures, and atmospheric deposition. Borealization is defined as enhanced soil acidification and litter accumulation, retarded nutrient cycling and changed forest climate in such planted coniferous forest ecosystems. An additional effect of borealization is a major decline in biodiversity of the stands. Based on a comparative study of Norway spruce and European beech stands in the Krkonose National Park (Czech Republic), it is concluded that traditional management should be abandoned and that management should instead focus on regeneration towards broadleaved or mixed forest stands, to enhance the stability of forest ecosystems and their biodiversity, and to reverse borealization in lower montane zones. Available surveys of forest typology were evaluated for their suitability in regeneration management and were found to be unsuitable, since they reflect the effects of borealization rather than true site conditions. The two main pioneer tree species, birch (Betula pendula) and mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia), were found to improve soil conditions and reverse borealization. Furthermore, trends in natural vegetation and soil development in declined forests and clear-cuts, and their relevance for forest restoration management were studied, focusing on borealization and plant species diversity. It is concluded that this natural development offers very good possibilities for a more passive, low-cost restoration management.")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "If forests are to be used in CO2 mitigation projects, it is essential to understand and quantify the impacts of disturbance on net ecosystem productivity (NEP; i.e., the change in ecosystem carbon (C) storage with time). We examined the influence of live tree and coarse woody debris (CWD) on NEP during secondary succession based on data collected along a 500-year chronosequence on the Wind River Ranger District, Washington. We developed a simple statistical model of live and dead wood accumulation and decomposition to predict changes in the woody component of NEP, which we call NEPw. The transition from negative to positive NEPw, for a series of scenarios in which none to all wood was left after disturbance, occurred between 0 and 57 years after disturbance. The timing of this transition decreased as live-tree growth rates increased, and increased as CWD left after disturbance increased. Maximum and minimum NEPw for all scenarios were 3.9 and -14.1 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. Maximum live and total wood C stores of 319 and 393 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, were reached approximately 200 years after disturbance. Decomposition rates (k) of CWD ranged between 0.013 and 0.043 year(-1) for individual stands. Regenerating stands took 41 years to attain a mean live wood mass equivalent to the mean mass of CWD left behind after logging, 40 years to equal the mean CWD mass in 500-year-old forest, and more than 150 years to equal the mean total live and dead wood in an old-growth stand. At a rotation age of 80 years, regenerating stands stored approximately half the wood C of the remaining nearby old-growth forests (predominant age 500 years), indicating that conversion of old-growth forests to younger managed forests results in a significant net release of C to the atmosphere.")

This perception is based on the assumption that changes in productivity with age in complex, multiaged, multispecies natural forests can be modelled simply as scaled-up versions of individual trees or even-aged stands. This assumption was tested by measuring the net primary productivity (NPP) of natural subalpine forests in the Northern Rocky Mountains, where NPP is from 50% to 100% higher than predicted by a model of an even-age forest composed of a single species. If process-based terrestrial carbon models underestimate NPP by 50% in just one quarter of the temperate coniferous forests throughout the world, then global NPP is being underestimated by 145 Tg of carbon annually. This is equivalent to 4.3-7.6% of the missing atmospheric carbon sink. These results emphasize the need to account for multiple-aged, species-diverse, mature forests in models of terrestrial carbon dynamics to approximate the global carbon budget.")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "To investigate the influence of forest conversion to pasture on soil N transformations, we compared soil inorganic-N pools and net mineralization and nitrification rates along two chronosequences of upland (terra firme) forest and pastures ranging in age from 4 to 82 years in the state of Rondonia in the western Brazilian Amazon Basin. Forest and pasture soils had similar total extractable inorganic-N pools at 0-5 and 5-10 cm depths. Ammonium-N and NO3--N pools were of similar magnitude in forest soils (2-10 mu g N g(-1) dry soil), while NH4+-N dominated pasture soil inorganic-N pools. Annual average net N mineralization rates for the two chronosequences at 0-5 cm depth in the forests were 1.31-1.88 mu g N g(-1) d.s. d(-1) and exceeded the annual average net N mineralization rates measured in pastures of -0.11-0.02 mu g N g(-1) d.s. d(-1). Annual average net nitrification rates at 0-5 cm depth in forest(1.09-1.46 mu g N g(-1) d.s. d(-1)) were also higher than in pastures (0.24-0.25 mu g N g(-1) d.s. d(-1)). Pasture soils had lower net N mineralization and net nitrification rates than forest soils even though they had approximately equal or higher total C and total N content. Pasture age did not affect NH4+-N pools or net nitrification rates, but decreased NO3--N pools and net N mineralization rates. Net N mineralization rate was unaffected by soil moisture, but net nitrification rate decreased at higher soil moisture. Higher net mineralization and nitrification rates in forest soils suggest a higher potential for NO3--N losses either through leaching or gaseous emissions from intact forests compared with established pastures.")

Reduced biodiversity has raised numerous concerns, including the possibility that ecosystem functioning may be affected negatively(1-4), which might be particularly important in the face of other global changes (5,6). Here we present results of a grassland field experiment in Minnesota, USA, that tests the hypothesis that plant diversity and composition influence the enhancement of biomass and carbon acquisition in ecosystems subjected to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations and nitrogen deposition. The study experimentally controlled plant diversity (1, 4, 9 or 16 species), soil nitrogen (unamended versus deposition of 4 g of nitrogen per m(2) per yr) and atmospheric CO2 concentrations using free-air CO2 enrichment (ambient, 368 mu mol mol(-1), versus elevated, 560 mu mol mol(-1)). We found that the enhanced biomass accumulation in response to elevated levels of CO2 or nitrogen, or their combination, is less in species-poor than in species-rich assemblages.")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "Interactive effects of reductions in plant species diversity and increases in atmospheric CO2 were investigated in a long-term study in nutrient-poor calcareous grassland. Throughout the experiment, soil nitrate was persistently increased at low plant species diversity, and CO2 enrichment reduced soil [NO3-] at all levels of plant species diversity. In our study, soil [NO3-] was unrelated to root length density, microbial biomass N, community legume contents, and experimental plant communities differed only little in total N pools. However, potential nitrification revealed exactly the same treatment effects as soil [NO3-], providing circumstantial evidence that nitrification rates drove the observed changes in [NO3-]. One possible explanation for plant diversity effects on nitrification lies in spatial and temporal interspecific differences in plant N uptake, which would more often allow accumulation of NH4+ in part of the soil profile at low diversity than in more species-rich plant communities. Consequently, nitrification rates and soil [NO3-] would increase. Elevated CO2 increased soil water contents, which may have improved NO3- diffusion to the root surface thereby reducing soil [NO3-]. Higher soil moisture at elevated CO2 might also reduce nitrification rates due to less aerobic conditions. The accordance of the diversity effect on soil [NO3-] with previous experiments suggests that increased soil [NO3-] at low species diversity is a fairly general phenomenon, although the mechanisms causing high [NO3-] may vary. In contrast, experimental evidence for effects of CO2 enrichment on soil [NO3-] is ambiguous, and the antagonistic interaction of plant species reductions and elevated CO2 we have observed is thus probably less universal.")

Interannual shifts in photosynthesis were associated with the timing of leaf expansion and senescence.

We analyze 3 years (1996-1998) of eddy-covariance carbon dioxide flux measurements from two contrasting deciduous forest ecosystems in the boreal and temperate regions of central Canada. The two forest stands have similar ages, heights, and leaf area indices but differ in species composition and climate. Mean annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was similar for the two ecosystems, varying between 0.7 and 2.7 t Cha(-1) (boreal) and 0.6 and 2.4 t Cha(-1) (temperate). In the boreal ecosystem, interannual differences in NEP were primarily controlled by early spring temperature. The warm spring of 1998 caused early leaf out and increased photosynthesis but had little effect on respiration. In the temperate ecosystem, the same warm spring not only caused early leaf out but also increased respiration and drought stress. The contrasting impact of the warm spring on annual NEP at the two sites illustrates the complexity of interpreting climatic impacts on the forest carbon balance. It also illustrates two competing influences of climate change on NEP: spring warming, which promotes photosynthesis and increases NEP, and increased soil temperature and drought, which promote respiration and reduce photosynthesis, thus reducing NEP. We discuss the need for a consistent data post-processing methodology in ecosystem intercomparisons. We also compare our results with a recent synthesis of data from European forests.")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "The lower montane zone of northwestern Ecuador, like many parts of the tropics, is undergoing rapid conversion from native forest vegetation to crop and pastureland. The current landscape is a mosaic of agricultural land, forest fragments and second-growth vegetation in various stages of development. While there is abundant research documenting the effects of land-use change in the lowland tropics, such information is scarce for montane regions on young volcanic soils. We compared foxtail pasture (Setaria sphacelata, [(Schumach.) Stapf and C.E. Hubb.]) and traditional, mixed-species pasture with undisturbed old-growth forest, 15-20 y-old secondary forest and 5-10 y-old shrubby regrowth. At two replicates of each vegetation class, we measured soil nitrogen and carbon pools, in situ net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification, soil respiration and soil physical properties. Setaria pasture decreased soil NO3--N pools and net mineralization and nitrification rates compared to mature forest, secondary vegetation, and mixed-species pasture. Soil NO3--N in Setaria pastures, during wet and dry seasons, was 40 and 25% of amounts measured in other vegetation types. Net nitrification rates were also lower beneath Setaria during both seasons, the greatest difference occurring during the wet season. Net nitrification rates increased considerably (two-fold and greater) under wet season conditions beneath all vegetation types except Setal ia pasture. Soils beneath both pasture types were wetter and had higher bulk density than mature and second-growth forests. Conversion to pasture produces widely varying effects on soil N dynamics depending on characteristics of the pasture species, such as Setaria['s extremely dense root system. Reduced soil N availability beneath Setaria pasture will affect both long-term pasture productivity and subsequent forest regeneration in abandoned pastures.")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "Wildfires and alien grass invasion threaten dry tropical forests throughout Central America. Efforts to preserve and restore these forests will require a better understanding of how conversion to grassland changes key belowground processes and organisms such as soil organic matter, nutrient cycling, and mycorrhizae. We studied forest, edge, and grassland soils from five 60-m transects perpendicular to abrupt forest-grassland boundaries in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica. Nutrient concentrations, N mineralization dynamics, and mycorrhizal fungal communities were compared across vegetation type (forest, edge, and grassland). The dynamics of N mineralization were measured in year-long laboratory incubations, and the diversity of mycorrhizal fungal communities was assessed from populations of soil-borne spores. Soil C, N, and K were lower, while many base cations and micronutrients were higher in grassland plots than in forest plots. Although differences in the quantity of total soil C and N occurred mainly in the forest-to-edge transition, differences in the quality of soil organic matter, as reflected by soil C:N ratios and mineralization rates, occurred in the edge-to-grassland transition. Beta diversity of mycorrhizal spore communities (measured by Sorenson's similarity index) was lower in the grassland plots than in the forest plots, indicating that grass invasion had caused some convergence. However, total spore density and alpha diversity of mycorrhizal spore communities (measured by species richness and Simpson's diversity index) were not altered by wildfires and grass invasion. These results suggest that persistence and regeneration of forest plant species in the grasslands may not be constrained to a significant degree by the lack of mycorrhizal symbionts. These grasslands appear to be sustainable, alternative stable states for these areas. Positive feedbacks between the alien grassland vegetation and both fire and nutrient cycling maintain and reinforce this alternative state.")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "Climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions is predicted to raise the mean global temperature by 1.0-3.5 degreesC in the next 50-100 years. The direct and indirect effects of this potential increase in temperature on terrestrial ecosystems and ecosystem processes are likely to be complex and highly varied in time and space. The Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems core project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme has recently launched a Network of Ecosystem Warming Studies, the goals of which are to integrate and foster research on ecosystem-level effects of rising temperature. In this paper, we use meta-analysis to synthesize data on the response of soil respiration, net N mineralization, and aboveground plant productivity to experimental ecosystem warming at 32 research sites representing four broadly defined biomes, including high (latitude or altitude) tundra, low tundra, grassland, and forest. Warming methods included electrical heat-resistance ground cables, greenhouses, vented and unvented field chambers, overhead infrared lamps, and passive nighttime warming. Although results from individual sites showed considerable variation in response to warming, results from the meta-analysis showed that, across all sites and years, 2-9 years of experimental warming in the range 0.3-6.0 degreesC significantly increased soil respiration rates by 20% (with a 95% confidence interval of 18-22%), net N mineralization rates by 46% (with a 95% confidence interval of 30-64%). and plant productivity by 19% (with a 95% confidence interval of 15-23%). The response of soil respiration to warming was generally larger in forested ecosystems compared to low tundra and grassland ecosystems, and the response of plant productivity was generally larger in low tundra ecosystems than in forest and grassland ecosystems. With the exception of aboveground plant productivity, which showed a greater positive response to warming in colder ecosystems, the magnitude of the response of these three processes to experimental warming was not generally significantly related to the geographic, climatic, or environmental variables evaluated in this analysis. This underscores the need to understand the relative importance of specific factors (such as temperature, moisture, site quality, vegetation type, successional status, land-use history, etc.) at different spatial and temporal scales, and suggests that we should be cautious in \"scaling up\" responses from the plot and site level to the landscape and biome level. Overall, ecosystem-warming experiments are shown to provide valuable insights on the response of terrestrial ecosystems to elevated temperature.")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "We evaluated the effects of plant functional group richness on seasonal patterns of soil nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, using serpentine grassland in south San Jose, California. We established experimental plots with four functional types of plants: early-season annual forbs (E), late-season annual forbs (L), nitrogen-fixers (N), and perennial bunchgrasses (P). These groups differ in several traits relevant to nutrient cycling, including phenology, rooting depth, root:shoot ratio, size, and leaf C:N content. Two or three species of each group were planted in single functional group (SFG) treatments, and in two-, three-, and four-way combinations of functional groups. We analyzed available nutrient pool sizes, microbial biomass nitrogen and phosphorus, microbial nitrogen immobilization, nitrification rates, and leaching losses. We used an index of \"relative resource use\" that incorporates the effects of plants on pool sizes of several depletable soil resources: inorganic nitrogen in all seasons, available phosphorus in all seasons, and water in the summer dry season. We found a significant positive relationship between increasing relative resource use (including both plant and microbial uptake) and increasing plant diversity. The increase in relative resource use results because different functional groups have their maximum effect on different resources in different seasons: E's dominate reduction of inorganic nitrogen pools in winter; L's have a stronger depletion of nitrogen in spring and a dominant reduction of water in summer; P's have a stronger nitrogen depletion in summer; N-fixers provide additional nitrogen in all seasons and have a significant phosphorus depletion in all seasons except fall. Single functional group treatments varied greatly in relative resource use; for example, the resource use index for the L treatment is as high as in the more diverse treatments. We expected a reduction of leaching losses as functional group richness increased because of differences in rooting depth and seasonal activity among these groups. However, measurements of nitrate in soil water leached below the rooting zone indicated that, apart from a strong reduction in losses in all vegetated treatments compared to the bare treatment, there were no effects of increasing plant diversity. While some single functional group treatments differed (P less than or equal to L, N), more diverse treatments did not. Early-and late-season annuals, but not perennial bunchgrasses, had significant positive effects on microbial immobilization of nitrogen in short-term (24 h) N-15 experiments. We conclude that: (1) total resource use, across many resource axes and including both plant and microbial effects, does increase with increasing plant diversity on a yearly timescale due to seasonal complementarity; (2) while the presence of vegetation has a large effect on ecosystem nitrogen retention, nitrogen leaching losses do not necessarily decrease with increasing functional group richness; (3) indirect effects of plants on microbial processes such as immobilization can equal or exceed direct effects of plant uptake on nutrient retention; and (4) plant composition (i.e., the identity of the groups present in treatments) in general explains much more about the measured nutrient cycling processes than does functional group richness alone (i.e., the number of groups present).")

We manipulated functional group diversity and composition by removing all possible combinations of zero. one, or two plant functional groups (forbs, C-3 graminoids, and C-4 graminoids), as well as randomly chosen biomass at levels corresponding to the functional group removals, from a prairie grassland community. Although random biomass removal treatments showed no significant effect of removing biomass in general on ecosystem functions measured (P > 0.05), the loss of particular functional groups led to significant differences in above(P<0.001) and belowground (P<0.001) biomass, rooting-zone (P=0.001) and leached (P=0.01) nitrogen, nitrogen miniralization (P<0.001), and community drought resistance (P = 0.002). Many of these differences stemmed from the marked difference in the ways remaining functional groups responded to the experimental removals. Strong recruitment limitation of C-4 graminoids resulted in large areas of open ground, high nutrient leaching. and high community drought resistance in plots containing just this functional group. In contrast, rhizomatous C-3 graminoids quickly colonized space and used soil resources made available by the removal of other groups, leading to lower soil nitrate in plots containing C-3 graminoids. These effects of recruitment limitation on ecosystem functioning illustrate possible effects of diversity loss not captured by synthetic experiments in which diversity gradients are created by adding high densities of seeds to bare soil.")

Studies of 16 sites in or near the Kadashan River basin demonstrated nonlinear, unimodal relations between flood frequency and SR, productivity and SR, and linear relations between SR and the spatial variation of flood frequencies (SVFF) within a site. SVFF is caused by microtopographic variation in elevation. A nonlinear regression model relating SR to flood frequency and SVFF explained much of the variation in SR between wetland communities. Sites with intermediate flood frequencies and high SVFF were species-rich, while sites frequently, rarely, or permanently flooded and with low SVFF were species-poor. The data suggest that small-scale spatial variation can dramatically alter the impact of disturbances. The data also support Michael Huston's dynamic-equilibrium model of species diversity, which predicts the effects of productivity and disturbance on diversity patterns. Species-rich sites had low to intermediate levels of productivity and intermediate flood frequencies, and species-poor sites had very low or high flood frequencies and low productivity, supporting the model's predictions. The model was tested at contrasting spatial scales (1000 m(2) and 1 m(2)). At the 1000-m(2)? scale, Huston's model predicted 78% of the variation in SR. At the microplot scale, relationships between SR and flood frequency were weaker, and the dynamic-equilibrium model predicted only 36%; of the variation in SR.")

Here we use a well-replicated field experiment, in which species diversity was directly controlled, to show that ecosystem productivity in 147 grassland plots increased significantly with plant biodiversity, Moreover, the main limiting nutrient, soil mineral nitrogen, was utilized more completely when there was a greater diversity of species, leading to lower leaching loss of nitrogen from these ecosystems. Similarly, in nearby native grassland, plant productivity and soil nitrogen utilization increased with increasing plant species richness. This supports the diversity-productivity and diversity-sustainability hypotheses. Our results demonstrate that the loss of species threatens ecosystem functioning and sustainability.")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "Biogeochemistry of terrestrial ecosystems is controlled by interactions among factors operating at several spatial and temporal scales. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative importance and interaction of relatively static landscape factors and more dynamic factors in a shortgrass steppe landscape. The landscape factors examined were topographic position, and soil texture. The dynamic factors studied were seasonal climate and the localized effects of individual plants on soils. Patterns were evaluated by sampling soil between and under individual Bouteloua gracilis plants in paired upland (erosional) and lowland (depositional) plots at eight locations at the Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER), Colorado. We quantified five organic C and N pools (total, fine and coarse particulate organic matter [POM], mineral-associated organic matter [MAOM], and potentially mineralizable C and N), and we estimated seasonal patterns of in situ N dynamics with three methods (extractable inorganic N, net N mineralization in uncovered cores, and N adsorbed on ion exchange resin [IER] bags). Topographic position and soil texture each explained much of the landscape-scale variation of C and N pools and vegetation structure. Most lowland plots were enriched in silt, clay, C, and N relative to adjacent upland plots, and topographic position affected most pools significantly. Most vegetation and biogeochemical variables were strongly correlated with soil sand content. Across the range of sand content encountered (40-83%), the fraction of area in bare soil openings >5 cm across increased sevenfold, and most C and N fractions increased by 2-4.5 times. Plant-induced, microscale heterogeneity of soil C and N was comparable in magnitude to landscape-scale heterogeneity for pools with more rapid turnover (POM and mineralizable C and N), but presence or absence of plants did not affect more stable, mineral-associated organic matter. Plant-induced heterogeneity was significant in all locations, but its importance likely decreases with decreasing sand content as cover becomes more continuous, particularly in lowlands. Total extractable inorganic N and nitrate, N adsorbed on resin bags, and the proportion of mineralized N that was nitrified during incubations increased with increasing soil water content or precipitation, but net N mineralization did not vary systematically with precipitation. Inorganic N availability was greatest during relatively moist spring periods, and these were the only times when indices of in situ N availability followed the spatial patterns expected from laboratory assays of C and N pool distribution. The relatively weak spatial patterns for N dynamics contrast with the substantial landscape and individual-plant scale variation in C and N pools. Landscape patterns of N mineralization and availability may be tied to N pools, such as POM N, that are not strongly related to topography or texture. Particulate organic matter appears to be especially important to N retention and availability on sandy soils, which typify most sites at the CPER; the proportion of total N residing in POM was high and POM C:N ratios were low in sandy upland soils. We suggest that soil texture is a key proximal control over biogeochemical processes and is largely responsible for observed landscape-scale patterns, including topographic differences. Models that integrate effects of texture and topography have the potential to link landscape biogeochemical patterns to short-term processes that directly influence SOM dynamics and to long-term geomorphic processes that influence soil distribution, including eolian redistribution of soil materials, which is important in many dry regions.")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "The eddy correlation method was used to measure the net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide continuously from April 1990 to December 1991 in a deciduous forest in central Massachusetts. The annual net uptake was 3.7 +/- 0.7 metric tons of carbon per hectare per year. Ecosystem respiration, calculated from the relation between nighttime exchange and soil temperature, was 7.4 metric tons of carbon per hectare per year, implying gross ecosystem production of 11.1 metric tons of carbon per hectare per year. The observed rate of accumulation of carbon reflects recovery from agricultural development in the 1800s. Carbon uptake rates were notably larger than those assumed for temperate forests in global carbon studies. Carbon storage in temperate forests can play an important role in determining future concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide.")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "The response of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and evaporation in a boreal aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) forest and a black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) forest in Canada was compared using a newly developed realistic model of surface-atmosphere exchanges of carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor, and energy as well as eddy covariance flux measurements made over a 6-year period (1994-1999). The model was developed by incorporating a process-based two-leaf (sunlit and shaded) canopy conductance and photosynthesis submodel in the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS). A simple submodel of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration was combined with the photosynthesis model to simulate NEP. The model performed well in simulating half-hourly, daily, and monthly mean CO2 exchange and evaporation values in both deciduous and coniferous forests. Modeled and measured results showed a linear relationship between CO2 uptake and evaporation, and for each kilogram of water transpired, approximately 3 g of carbon (C) were photosynthesized by both ecosystems. The model results confirmed that the aspen forest was a weak to moderate C sink with considerable interannual variability in C uptake. In the growing season, the C uptake capacity of the aspen forest was over twice that of the black spruce forest. Warm springs enhanced NEP in both forests; however, high mid-summer temperatures appear to have significantly reduced NEP at the black spruce forest as a result of increased respiration. The model suggests that the black spruce forest is a weak C sink in cool years and a weak C source in warm years. These results show that the C balance of these two forests is sensitive to seasonal and interannual climatic variability and stresses the importance of continuous long-term flux measurement to confirm modeling results.")

	(bibtex:hasAbstract "Although it is generally accepted that the rate of accumulation of biomass declines as forests age, little is known about the relative contributions to this decline of changes in net primary production (NPP) and tree mortality. We used 10-15 years of observations of permanent plots in three small watersheds in and near the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, to examine these issues. The three watersheds are of similar elevation and potential productivity and support young (29 years at last measurement), mature (similar to100 years) and old (similar to400 years) forest dominated by Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco and Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg. Accumulation of tree bole biomass was greatest in the young stand, reaching similar to7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in the last measurement interval, Bole biomass accumulation was relatively constant (similar to4-5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) in the mature stand, and there was no net accumulation of bole biomass in the old-forest stand. The NPP of boles increased with time in the young stand, from similar to3 to similar to7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), but was nearly constant in the mature and old-forest stands, at similar to6 and 3-4 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. Mortality increased slowly in the young stand (from < 0.1 to 0.3 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)), but fluctuated between 1-2 and 2-6 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in the mature and old-forest stands, respectively. Thus, declining biomass accumulation with stand age reflects, in approximately equal amounts, both decreasing NPP and increasing mortality.")
