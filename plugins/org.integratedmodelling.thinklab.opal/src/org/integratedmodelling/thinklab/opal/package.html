		<p>OPAL (Ontology Portability and Access Layer) is an XML-based formalism that allows creating a readable XML syntax to declare instances
		of an arbitrary OWL or RDFS ontology. The syntax can be translated into RDF individuals (instances) by an OPAL processor, and from there
		back to RDF if wanted. At the same time, an OPAL processor can translate a set of instances into an OPAL document.</p>
		
		<p>Through OPAL, any ontology defines a human- and machine-friendly declarative language. The structure of the language is entirely
		defined by the ontology. The main features of the declarative language are:</p>
		
		<ul>
		   <li>OPAL simplifies instance definition by providing defaulting of unambiguous relationships; if properties that link to instances
			   are unambiguous, instances of the target class can be simply included in the declaration of other instances. </li>
		   <li>OPAL provides plug-in validation of complex literals that represent instances of types beyond XML schema. For instance,
		  	   a GIS shape can be expressed as a Well Known Text literal, and translated by the OPAL processor into an instance of 
		  	   a class representing a shape. </li>
		   <li>OPAL provides an abstraction layer over common declarative problems, such as using properties that
			   link to classes in OWL-DL. Such issues are handled in a configurable way by the OPAL processor.</li>	 
		</ul>
		
		<p>OPAL provides a generalized mechanism to name and reference objects so that multiple references are possible. Namespaces represent
		ontologies. If no ambiguity exists, the OPAL processor can be configured to work without namespaces for maximum simplicity. </p>
