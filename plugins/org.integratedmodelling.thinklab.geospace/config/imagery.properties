## add each service with the ordinal number that it should be tried at - 0 is tried first, if it
## doesn't work get to 1 etc. Do not leave gaps. The URL should point to a WMS getCapabilities 
## service.
## If no layers are specified, the imagery is generated by asking for all available layers. If
## a specific layer is wanted, add 
## imagery.wms.layer.0 = layername
## substituting 0 with the number of the service and layername with the desired layer.
