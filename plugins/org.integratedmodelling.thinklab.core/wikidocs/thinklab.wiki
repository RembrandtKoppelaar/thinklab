Thinklab is a modular toolkit to develop knowledge-driven applications. With its web interface project, 
[thinkcap], it provides a complete enviroment to develop and deploy full intelligent applications. It
is written mostly in Java, but it can be programmed in any language that targets the JVM. A growing 
part of Thinklab is written in Clojure, a Lisp dialect that runs on the JVM.
