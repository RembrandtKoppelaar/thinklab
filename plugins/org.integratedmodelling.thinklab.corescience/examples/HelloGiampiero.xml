<!-- We hereby state that we have identified Giampiero in a specific temporal location. Observing
     Giampiero has the side effect of us observing his wife, Giuseppona, who is a much nicer person. In fact, it turns
     out that our observation of Giampiero's wife happens in a year extent, while we only say hello to Giampiero for
     a meager millisecond. So the contextualization of this will have to compound those observations and 
     figure out the common temporal context.

     If we were really sick, we could subclass Identification into, for example, Greeting, which implies
     that a side effect of the identification is saying hello.
	
	Note how this becomes the observation ontology equivalent of Hello, World. Except we 
	say hello to Giampiero instead, which makes more sense as we don't really observe
	the World.
