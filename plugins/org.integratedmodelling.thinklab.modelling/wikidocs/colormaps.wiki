Colormaps can be specified in a property file using a simple language documented below. Plug-ins can
load colormaps from such files. An obvious location for colormap files is a ~~colormap.properties~~ file in
the plugin's config directory; some plugins (modelling, aries.core) are automatically set up to use such
files.

The property file links colormaps to the concept that describes an observable. Any colormap associated
with a concept will be used for all subclasses of that concept unless a more specific definition is
available. More than one colormaps can be defined for a concept, separating definitions with a comma
on the same line. Multiple definitions are used to handle situations in which the number of colors in
the preferred colormap is not enough to handle the data; in that case, the following colormap will be
used instead, until one has enough colors. All data are compressed to a maximum of 255 levels anyway.
