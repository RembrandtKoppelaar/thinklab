To setup in eclipse:

1. checkout as a Java project
2. create a new run configuration for project Thinklab, using main class org.java.plugin.boot.Boot
3. in the run configuration's classpath, remove everything under User entries, then Add Jar and select ONLY lib/jpf-boot.jar
4. That's it - run it and the Shell plugin will be loaded from the corresponding plugin (see
	boot.properties for configuration). The pload command loads plugins on demand.
